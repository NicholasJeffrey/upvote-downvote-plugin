# upvote-downvote-plugin
Simple upvote and downvote plugin for woocommerce products or any other content using a shortcode 


== Description ==

Hello Basab & Team. 

I need a simple and light plugin to enable up-and downvotes for woocommerce products or pretty much any wordpress post. 

This plugin should allow to add an upvote and down vote rating/ thumb up thumb down rating button to content via a shortcode. 

This plugin should also register custom fields in wordpress called _thumbs_rating_up _thumbs_rating_down so that I can use them with other plugins such as the toolset suite in order to filter for the post with the most upvotes.

I would love to use this plugin in conjunction with Toolset Views, so that I can easily create custom views and also filter the posts and content regarding the highest or lowest rating/upvote/downvote count. 

For example: Use the Toolset views plugin and add a filter for the upvote field and set a value for it so that the view only displays products with upvotes greater than the value of x 


= Features =

*   Show the buttons anywhere using shortcodes.
*   Use HTML5 LocalStorage to prevent the users from voting twice.
*   Enable to cancel an up or downvote in case you made a mistake
*   Clear all upvotes and downvotes (not so important)
*   Easily customize the output using CSS.
*   Register the relevant custom fields with wordpress in order to use them with other plugins
*   Use Toolset Views in conjuction with the custom fields of the plugin in order to filter for the upvotes or downvotes posts/products 


= Shortcode =


Add the shortcode to the posts or pages you want the Thumb Rating buttons to appear:
